# CUDA_FORTRAN_BiCGStab
Test configuration for a BiCGStab implementation in Fortran using CUDA cuSparse routines

This repos contains a set of files for testing implementations of a BiCGStab solver
written in fortran and using CUDA cuSparse routines; the repo was created in order
to ask for help on StackOverflow while providing source code. These solvers were
written for a legacy Fortran 77 code with the added restriction of only being able 
to use a fortran compiler (as opposed to having a c/c++ interface). 

NOTE
====
Testing has been performed using the CUDA 9.1 Toolkit and iFort 17.0.4.196

GPU being used is a Tesla P4 card

FILES
=====
maklefile_testcuda : Makefile (with debugging flags) used for the test case

test_fortcuda.for : Main test program with a simple test system (5x5 matrix with 13 non-zeros,
                    a right hand side, and a known solution) and three logical flags
                    for using the three implemented solvers. This is written in f77 
                    standard to emulate the legacy code.
                    
cuda_fortran_solvers.f90 : Fortran header-equivalent module for referencing CUDA
                           functions and three solvers implemented as subroutines.
                           
---> module cuda_cusolve_map : Interface module to cuda functions for reference within
                               fortran code. This was largely modeled on the corrected
                               answer from 
   https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/882492/gpu-accelerated-libraries/using-cusolverdn-in-fortran-code/
                           
---> subroutine cuda_sparse_solve_qr : Direct solver using QR decomposition. This solver
                                       is working and is used to confirm that the
                                       interface module is performing correctly. This was
                                       modeled from the CUDA sample cuSolverSp_LinearSolver.cpp
                                       -- method1 in test_fortcuda.for
                                       
---> subroutine cuda_BiCGStab : Iterative BiCGStab solver based on the CUDA sample 
                                pbicgstab.cpp using the standard ILU preconditioner.
                                -- method2 in test_fortcuda.for
                                
---> subroutine cuda_BiCGStab2 : Iterative BiCGStab solver based off of the previous subroutine
                                 and the example usage domino scheme cusparseDcsrilu02 (section 10.9-11
                                 of the CUDA 9.1 Toolkit documentation). This was
                                 mainly implemented as a sanity check of the previous cuda_BiCGStab.
